# PetroLog
PetroLog is a cross-platform mobile app using Flutter and Dart, designed to help users track their fuel consumption, mileage, and vehicle-related expenses. To ensure real-time data synchronization and secure cloud storage, I integrated Firebase services, including Firestore for database management and Firebase Authentication for user login and account security. The app features a clean, user-friendly interface, detailed fuel log entries, expense summaries, and visual insights to help users understand their driving habits and costs. Itâ€™s built to be scalable, reliable, and accessible from any device.
